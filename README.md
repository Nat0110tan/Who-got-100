# Who-got-100
Rule: each player can click the roll dice button to get a number from 1 to 6, they can decide when to hold their current score and that will be added to the total score of that player, and then the game move to the next round. If a player get 1 then their current number will be 0 and their round is over. 
When a player's total score is greater than 100, that player will win the game.
